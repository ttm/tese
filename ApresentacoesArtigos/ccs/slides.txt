the cultural industry concept is recurrent in our
research because it is a deep trace of the late capitalism
when the the industrial culture permeates the spare time
of the workers.
The social organization is also a way to produce subjectivity,
such as related to ticket/stereotyped thinking and prejudice.
A new anthropology is yielded by the advent of a new technology
such as the radio or the internet.
A strong paradigm for us is "The Authoritarian personality"
 work (Adorno and collabs) because it is
a research between science and social critic.
 We find it a fit for the needs of our time.
