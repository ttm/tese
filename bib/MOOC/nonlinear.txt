Intro
most systemas are not linear, most are chaotic (large subset of non linear)
-> experimental mathematics

v2
maps discrete
flows continuous

difference equations for maps
transiente phase and fixed point

1.3 Transients and attractors
orbit or trajectory of the dynamics
state variables 
attracting/stable vs repelling/unstable fixed points
basin of attraction

1.4 params and bifurcationss
periodics orbit r limit cycle
bifurcation changes the topology of the attractor
Parameter
