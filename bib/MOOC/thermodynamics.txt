"Thermodynamics is the study of transfering energy".
(obtaining, transfering, applying energy)

vapor state == gas state

process knowledge

lec 11
conduction, convection and radiation as 3 classic types of energy transfer

extensive (mass, volume) properties and 
intensive (temperature, pressure, density, specific volume) proerties
equilibrium
process

1.06 work transfer = \int F ds

2.02
polytropic process are Power Laws!!!

2.03
first law of thermodynamics
E= EC + EP + U
U, the internal energy, is usually the most important


2.04
Saturation state
Critical Point (critical temperature)
Phase diagrams

2.06
quality
superheated vapor
subcolled liquid
isotherms isobars
